    "After getting unexpected criticism in a meeting, Chris felt his jaw clench and a sarcastic comment rise up. He nearly let it fly. But the reaction felt too sharp — not like him. He paused, asked what was driving it, and saw it was an old “I’ve got to prove myself” memory from the Army playing in his head. That helped him ReFrame it: “I can listen and still keep my self-respect.” He responded with a calm question instead.",
    "Chris noticed he kept dwelling on a disagreement with his wife. Same thoughts, same irritation — no movement. He finally caught himself and used What’s Most Important. He realized this pattern wasn’t helping his values or his relationship. He reframed it: “I can’t change what was said, but I can show up better next time.” That freed him up to focus on what mattered: reconnecting with her."

    'Step 1 – Describe the Event: Be specific and objective. Focus on one event at a time and stick to the facts — avoid labeling or exaggerating.',
    'Step 2 – Identify and distinguish between your heat-of-the-moment thoughts and beliefs, as well as your emotions and behaviors — including both your physical behaviours and your physiological behaviours.',
    'Step 3 – Identify what influenced your thoughts or beliefs: your values or “shoulds,” past experiences, other factors, or your internal board of directors.',
    'Step 4 – Determine if your reaction is helping or harming your performance, values, goals or relationships.',
    'Step 5 – Ask yourself: What is most important right now? How can you ReFrame your thoughts about the event to get a more productive outcome?',
    'Step 6 – Make a new plan if needed. Do you need to implement that plan now or in the future?'
